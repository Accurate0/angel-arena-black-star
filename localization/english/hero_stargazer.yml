npc_arena_hero_stargazer: Stargazer
npc_arena_hero_stargazer_hype: 'The mysterious Stargazing Shadow moves around the battlefield, repelling damage to enemies and incinerating them with a beam of clean energy. Even despite the Split, the Stargaizer continues to grow, although not so fast, but even so it will be difficult for enemies to surpass it.'
npc_arena_hero_stargazer_bio: 'Ancient essence, born at the dawn of the universe, Stargaizer, personifies by its existence curiosity, peculiar to everyone. Traveling through the worlds, Stargaizer absorbs knowledge and experience of living beings like a sponge, becoming stronger with every moment. No one knows what it knows, whether it has consciousness - no one has yet come into contact with this astral entity. The stargazing increases and becomes larger, as the Universe itself: the more worlds, the more space, the faster the flow of time, the stronger, smarter and more clever the Stargazer. However, Split stirred up the entire Universe. This phenomenon also affected him - the Universe split in half, which affected his powers, which prevented him from moving further in the knowledge of being. Therefore, Stargaizer stepped on the battlefields of the Angels and Demons. Gathering the remnants of his forces, he will do everything necessary for the disappearance of the anomaly, in order to restore everything to normal, to restore order. After all, there will be no order and development of the Universe - there will not be Stargeyzer. To perish or grow - the third is not given to him.'
