npc_arena_hero_saber_bio: "Many believe that King Arthur was a man. But, as often happens, legends are not always true. Saber, or Arturia, was born in the time of chaos and wars that began with the collapse of the Roman Empire. The empire was considered inviolable, but everyone expected its destruction at the hands of invading barbarians. In preparation for the war against the barbarians, Rome stripped its island province of all the military forces on it. After Britain lost the protection of the empire, it could not escape independence, as a result of which it was shattered into smaller parts. During these barbarian invasions and self-destruction from the constant struggle between the clans, a long period of war began, which later became known as the «Dark Ages». Arturia was born during this period, as the heir to the throne, the daughter of the King of England, Uther Pendragon, and the blue-eyed Igraina, the wife of the servant Uther, the Duke of Cornwall. The king believed in Merlin is prophecy and longed for the birth of a child to designate him as successor, but the child was not born the way he had expected. The legend says that Merlin helped Uther to spend the night with Igreina, and as a payment demanded to leave him to Arthur for education, saying: «I will lead the correct way of this child, carrying a great destiny, and protect him from enmity and evil that reign in the royal Court.» The reality was that Arturia was not born a boy, and the king could not make a woman his successor, even if the destiny of this child to become a king once. She was instructed by the king is vassal to be educated as a simple knight. Realizing the situation, the king fell into despair, but Merlin was delighted, because the floor absolutely does not matter, in order to become a king. He was sure, the fact that the girl will be away from the castle until the day of prophecy, will be proof that she will become king. On the day of prophecy, knights and lords assembled from all over the country to choose the next king. Everyone expected that the best for the role of the king will be chosen with the help of knightly competitions, but the only thing that was on the site of selection was a naked sword stuck in the stone, with a gold inscription on the hilt: «The king of the law for England will be he who is this sword of stone Will take it out.» Many knights tried to pull the sword, but none could do it. After all the assembled failed and decided to choose the king by the usual, chivalrous method, Arturia, who did not yet have the right to the title of knight, approached the stone at the empty spot of selection and without hesitation reached for the sword. Before grabbing him, Merlin appeared before her and said to think it over before taking it. He told her that by taking this sword, she would no longer be a man, but she only nodded, because she was ready to «become a king, then cease to be a man» since birth. She knew that the king is the one who will kill anyone to protect everyone. She thought about it every night and decided with the arrival of the morning. Although it was not one day, she said that everything will end today. She easily pulled out her sword, and the square was filled with light. At that moment, she ceased to be just a man. The king's sex does not matter, and no one will care about his appearance until the king behaves like a king. Even if someone noticed that the king was a woman, it would not be a problem if she was a good king. The time of the king began, which will become a legend. Arturia needed to behave like the son of a king, because in order to control many territories and control knights, one had to be a man. And although some people grew suspicious, only her father, Merlin and Kay knew the truth about her personality. To hide the truth about herself for life, she literally closed herself in the armor, and thanks to her immortality because of the protection of fairies, no one had any questions about her small body, or a person more like a girl. She was revered by knights as a handsome king, and seemed an invincible warrior whose appearance or body size influenced her position."
